This folder houses data acquired from the literature. The "master_permeability_data_with_references.csv" file encompasses various gas permeability data of homopolymers along with their respective references and additional details. 
This file was utilized to generate distinct CSV files for CO2, CH4, and N2 gas permeabilities. Units of gas permeabilities are in Barrer. The CO2/CH4 and CO2/N2 selectivity data were obtained by dividing the experimental permeabilities are also provided. 
These data were used for training the gas permeability and selectivity ML models used in this work.
